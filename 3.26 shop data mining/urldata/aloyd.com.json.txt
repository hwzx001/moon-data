And when you pair Coach by Color with the ICG training app, expert instruction from Team ICG coaches you to achieve your goals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://shop.lifefitness.com/UserFiles/IC7-CoachByColor-570x570.jpg%20\" alt=\" width=\" height=\"570\"></p>","published_at":"2017-06-23T12:19:47-05:00","created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:39-05:00","updated_at":"2019-09-13T09:50:06-05:00","vendor":"Life Fitness","product_type":"Bikes","tags":["bikes","commercial-cardio","less-than-5000","life-fitness","no-price","spinner","spinner-indoor-cycle","spinning"],"variants":[{"id":41380747011,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"LF-IC-LFIC7","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"3499.00","grams":68039,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":10545043139,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:39-05:00","updated_at":"2018-09-11T18:00:36-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":23151050051,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:55:00-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/LF-IC7-02-1000x1000.jpg?v=1498240571","width":1000,"height":1000},{"id":23151049923,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:59-05:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/LF-IC7-01-1000x1000.jpg?v=1498240571","width":1000,"height":1000},{"id":23151050307,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:55:01-05:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/LF-IC7-03-1000x1000.jpg?v=1498240571","width":1000,"height":1000},{"id":23151050691,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:55:04-05:00","position":4,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/LF-IC7-EnvironmentRender-1000x1000.jpg?v=1498240571","width":1000,"height":1000},{"id":23151048771,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:51-05:00","position":5,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/01-IC7-WattRate-570x570.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151048835,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:52-05:00","position":6,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/02-IC7-BikeFit-570x570.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151048963,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:53-05:00","position":7,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/03-IC7-MagneticResistance-570x570B.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151049091,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:54-05:00","position":8,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/04-IC7-Drivetrain-570x570B.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151049219,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:55-05:00","position":9,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/05-IC7-UserAssistPost-570x570.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151049347,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:56-05:00","position":10,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/06-IC7-QFactor-570x570.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151049475,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:56-05:00","position":11,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/IC7-CoachByColor-570x570.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570},{"id":23151049731,"created_at":"2017-06-23T12:54:58-05:00","position":12,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T12:56:11-05:00","product_id":10545043139,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/1801/products/IC7-ConsoleDisplays.jpg?v=1498240571","width":570,"height":570}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":10545021955,"title":"Life Fitness IC5 Indoor Cycle","handle":"life-fitness-ic5-indoor-cycle","body_html":"<p> </p>\n<h6>Overview</h6>\n<p>The IC5 combines innovative design with precision engineering and high-quality mechanical components.

Of course, if you add some 5 lb plates to get up to 75 lbs first then the 120 lb add on kit will take you all the way up to 120 lbs total.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003ewarranty\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifetime warranty!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eresources\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pKibJGkPTwU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br \/\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fDhVScu70Uw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2016-09-29T17:55:00-05:00","created_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:00-05:00","updated_at":"2020-03-25T21:05:16-05:00","vendor":"IronMaster","product_type":"Weight Sets","tags":["ironmaster","less-than-1000","less-than-2500","less-than-500","less-than-5000","powerblock-dumbbell","weight-sets"],"variants":[{"id":29117409731,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"IM-45","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"479.00","grams":90718,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":8673281859,"created_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:01-05:00","updated_at":"2020-03-25T21:00:30-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":17488006851,"created_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:11-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:11-05:00","product_id":8673281859,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/45-1.jpg?v=1475251091","width":800,"height":800},{"id":17488007299,"created_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:13-05:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:13-05:00","product_id":8673281859,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/45-2.jpg?v=1475251093","width":800,"height":710},{"id":17488011139,"created_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:20-05:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2016-09-30T10:58:20-05:00","product_id":8673281859,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/45-3.png?v=1475251100","width":800,"height":782}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":8665127363,"title":"IronMaster Super Bench","handle":"ironmaster-superbench","body_html":"\u003ch6\u003especifications\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e11 lock out angles: Inclines, Declines, Flat and Upright. 0, 5,10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 85 degrees.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1000 lb rated, 11 \u0026amp; 12 gauge super strong steel frame.

Home Gym usage, the ultimate 2-stack gym! Whether you're looking for the best multi-station gym for your home or a great multi-station gym for your commercial facility, the M5 has everything you'd ever need! Its unique press arm offers both fixed pressing exercises as well as free motion movements. Why is this important? Well, fixed pressing exercises help develop size and strength, while free motion movements improve mobility and coordination. Also featured is the seated leg curl station for shaping glutes and strengthening hamstring muscles. A patented dual back pad tilt for superior fit and comfort is also standard. In its construction it uses commercial 11 gauge steel for its frame, nylon pulleys (not plastic), 2000lb. tensile strength cables, and precision ball bearings in its press arm pivot. Along with two tone high gloss paint and orthopedic pads, the M5 is not only highly functional; itâ€™s a sight to behold. The bench press pivot points have 1-1\/2\" Precision Steel Ball Bearings. All other parts pivot on Oil Impregnated Brass Bushings to ensure a smooth and fluid motion with NO maintenance.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOptional \u003ca title=\"LP3 Leg Press\" href=\"https:\/\/fitnessexperience.ca\/collections\/home-gyms\/products\/inspire-lp3-leg-press-option\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eLP3 Leg Press\u003c\/a\u003e (Not as pictured)\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Product only available at Manitoba \u0026amp; Vancouver Island Fitness Experience Locations\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eSpecifications\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDimensions\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLength (Depth) 250cm \/ 100\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWidth - Footprint 220cm \/ 88\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWidth - Lat Bar Height 208.75cm \/ 83.5\" - 212.5cm \/ 85\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProduct Weight 322kg \/ 708lb\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser Weight 150kg \/ 330lb \/ 23.5 Stone\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(With Optional \u003ca title=\"LP3 Leg Press\" href=\"https:\/\/fitnessexperience.ca\/collections\/home-gyms\/products\/inspire-lp3-leg-press-option\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eLP3 Leg Press\u003c\/a\u003e) \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLength (Depth) 290cm \/ 116\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWidth 220cm \/ 88\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHeight 208.75cm \/ 83.5\" - 212.5cm \/ 85\"\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWeight Stack 2 x 95kg \/ 210lb\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrame Heavy Duty 2 x 4\" Oval \u0026amp; 3\" Round 11 Gauge Tubular Steel\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePaint Finish Two Tone Electrostatic Powder Coat offers a durable maintenance free finish\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePulleys Fibreglass Reinforced Nylon (not plastic)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCables 2000lb Tensile Strength\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePivot Points 1.5\" Precision Steel Bearings at Bench Press \u0026amp; Oil Impregnated Brass Bushings on other parts for a smooth and fluid motion with no maintenance required\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUpholstery Contoured Orthopaedic Pads\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShrouds Heavy Duty Canvas\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeat 6 Position height adjustable\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBackrest 5 Position multi-angle\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRollers 6 Vinyl Covered Foam\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePress Station Easy adjustable with 4 Standard \u0026amp; 4 Reverse Positions featuring a Free Motion Cable System to improve mobility and co-ordination\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHigh Pulley Seperate from Press Station to allow for 2 Users simultaneously.

Its unique press arm offers both fixed pressing exercises as well as free motion movements. Why is this important? Well, fixed pressing exercises help develop size and strength, while free motion movements improve mobility and coordination. For maximum benefit in a minimum amount of time, the M2 is the answer.

Built to Take Punishment.\u003c\/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set out to design a machine that can take what it dishes out. Thick-gauge chro-moly steel, sealed cartridge bearings and over sized pivots ensure the Assault holds up hundreds of thousands of maintenance-free hours of use on the military base, on campus, in the gym, physical therapy or at home. Built for the commercial environment and will prove to hold up to the most demanding abuse.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eBuilt-In Durability â€“ A 20-Bearing Salute.\u003c\/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we set out to design the Assault Air Bike, we knew that integration of sealed cartridge bearings in every pivot and moving part was an absolute necessity and were more than a little shocked when the count totaled twenty. Thatâ€™s a bearing or two in every pivot, be it pedals, bottom bracket, flywheels or linkage arms. Twenty sealed-bearings in allâ€¦tucked and hidden neatly away under machined and formed steel.You can say that itâ€™s the things that you canâ€™t see that make the biggest difference.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eThe Computer, Watts Up.\u003c\/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started from scratch with the design of the Assaultâ€™s console.LCD technology offers a versatile array of display images. Large buttons and quick keys to offer faster access to the on-board programs, while the screen is packed full of useful data feedback.Simultaneously monitor heart rate, speed, RPM, time, Watts and calories..All this functionality in a sleek, compact heads-up display. Since Watts were important to to our development team, we knew we had to get this rightâ€¦and we did. Our first task was to connect the Assaultâ€™s drivetrain to 20 horsepower electric motor, enabling us to deliver a constant RPM. We then coupled a calibrated torque measurement meter to the drivetrain and recorded output at each RPM increment from 5 to 150 RPMs. With a simple math conversion, the Assault was armed with actual Watt output values.

new SFID325 Commercial Adjustable bench is designed to meet any facility’s requirements without breaking the bank. Utility benches are a critical part of any commercial or vertical market facility. Home use benches often incorporate leg attachments that get in the way of many exercises. Home use benches also do not have the quality to hold up in a commercial environment. The SFID325 satisfies both of these needs in an affordable quality bench. The unit adjusts from decline to flat to several incline positions. The back pad and seat pad adjust individually of each other. The SFID325 has a tested weight capacity of over 1000 pounds with its 2\"x3\", eleven-gauge steel. Thick durable upholstery holds up in any setting. Oversized wheels with a front transport handle make the SFID325 very easy to move. The perfect match for dumbbell workouts, smith machines, squat racks and power racks, the SFID325 is an essential bench for any facility at an amazing value.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eSpecifications\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e74 pounds\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2\"x3\", eleven-gauge steel\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIndependent back pad and seat pad adjustments\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1000 pound capacity tested\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThick, durable padding\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTransport wheels for easy movement\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBack pad adjusts flat, incline (15, 30, 45, 60 and 80 degrees) and decline (-18 degrees)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeat pad adjusts flat, 10, and 18 degrees\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHeight to pad –flat position 18”\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBack Pad tapers 9.5” -12” towards seat pad\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDimensions: 25.5\"W x 57.5\"L x 18\"H\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2015-02-25T12:47:00-06:00","created_at":"2015-02-25T12:47:44-06:00","updated_at":"2020-03-03T16:54:42-06:00","vendor":"Body-Solid","product_type":"Benches","tags":["benches","body-solid","less-than-1000","less-than-2500","less-than-5000"],"variants":[{"id":1200190747,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"SFID325","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"649.00","grams":43091,"compare_at_price":"0.00","position":1,"product_id":459464747,"created_at":"2015-02-25T12:47:44-06:00","updated_at":"2020-03-03T16:54:42-06:00"}],"images":[{"id":1264694571,"created_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","product_id":459464747,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/SFID325_HERO_3f27ab1e-0068-4348-9366-ffc240aec71d.png?v=1429563122","width":600,"height":600},{"id":1264694575,"created_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","product_id":459464747,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/SFID325_EX_ShouldPress.png?v=1429563122","width":600,"height":600},{"id":1264694579,"created_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","position":3,"updated_at":"2015-04-20T15:52:02-05:00","product_id":459464747,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/SFID325_HERO02.png?v=1429563122","width":600,"height":600}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":459464743,"title":"Body Solid SCB26 Squat\/Calf Block","handle":"body-solid-scb26-squat-calf-block","body_html":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s a combination squat platform for stabilizing the user during squat exercises and calf block for the most intense calf raise exercises with full range of motion, and complete comfort.

Manta Ray is the most significant advancement in freeweight training in 75 years. It’s a semi-rigid device that snaps onto any bar and helps you achieve the full advantage of performing the high bar Squat with the proper upright posture and without the discomfort. Manta Ray’s superior load distribution principle transfers the weight across your Trapezius muscles, eliminating neck pain and allowing you to focus on the movement. Great for Lunges too.

As the concept of functional training has grown in popularity, the use of water-filled implementation training has become more accepted amongst strength and conditioning, as well as fitness professionals. As these devices are moved, the mass of the device invariably shifts as it is more unstable than a traditional barbell or dumbbell. These shifts cause disruptions in the normal movement path of an exercise and increase the demands placed on the muscles of the trunk and joint stabilizers to counteract postural disturbances. By enhancing the stability of the core and the specific joints required to stabilize a movement, more efficient movement can be produced at the joints required to be mobile to execute a task as the agonists, antagonists, and stabilizer muscles function in a more organized and synergistic fashion.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen analyzing these types of activities, it appears that the \u003cspan\u003eSURGE™ \u003c\/span\u003emay provide a contextually appropriate training stimulus due to the top down instability created by the constant shifting of fluid within this device.

But conventional foam rollers have smooth surfaces that further compress soft tissue. Rolling on top of them improves blood flow and tissue flexibility, but the effect is limited and relatively superficial, unless you spend a lot of time rolling.  The RumbleRoller was created to perform this therapy more effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe RumbleRoller Manipulates Soft Tissue - Like a Massage Therapist!\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe surface of the RumbleRoller contains specially designed bumps that are firm, but flexible, much like the thumbs of a massage therapist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you roll over the top of the RumbleRoller, the bumps continuously knead the contours of your body, gently stretching soft tissue (muscle and fascia) in multiple directions. This action erodes trigger points, helps restore flexibility, and brings quick relief to common types of muscular pain. By design, the RumbleRoller's bumps are firmer than muscle tissue, but much softer than bone, so they deflect out of the way if they contact your spine or other bony protrusions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough simple techniques, you can control the amount of pressure the bumps apply to your body. The bumps are closely spaced to one another (\u0026lt; 2\" apart), so several of them simultaneously contact your body during most exercises. However, with a slight shift of your body, you can reduce your area of contact with the RumbleRoller, which increases pressure and provides deeper, more penetrating relief. RumbleRoller foam roller with bumps\u003cbr\u003eAdd Another Dimension to Your Foam Roller Program\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's massaging action can be further intensified by changing your movement from a back-and-forth rolling motion to a side-to-side rocking motion. That's because the RumbleRoller's bumps have an asymmetrical shape that allows them to flex more easily in one direction. During rolling movements (i.e. the most common roller exercises, with the roller moving beneath you), the bumps flex relatively easily, and provide a wiping-type massage pressure. However, if you rock from side-to-side toward the RumbleRoller's ends, the bumps are forced to flex in a direction in which they're designed to be somewhat stiffer. This creates a deeper \"digging\" pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich Roller is Best for You?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller is made in two different sizes, and each size is available in two different densities. The information below will help you choose the best model for your particular needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull-Size or Compact\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you plan to use your RumbleRoller in a single location -- e.g. at home -- you'll love the full-size model, because its extra length makes it more efficient for performing many exercises. It's long enough to roll the widest part of your back in one pass; you can roll both legs (quads, hamstrings, and\/or calves) at the same time; and you can even transition from one IT band to the other without moving the roller. With the Compact RumbleRoller, you'll need to roll each leg separately, and will spend a little more time repositioning yourself between exercises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major advantage the Compact RumbleRoller has over the full-size model is its portability. At just 12\" in length, it fits easily in your gym bag, backpack, or carry-on luggage. This makes it a favorite of many runners and triathletes who transport theirs from race to race. The Compact RumbleRoller's smaller diameter (5\" vs. 6\" for the full-size model) allows it to conform better to the curvature of some body parts, such as your neck. The Compact RumbleRoller also costs less than the full-size model, which may be important if your budget is limited. Compact RR is perfect for travel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Density or Extra-Firm\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you're new to foam rolling or have gotten positive results from any type of conventional foam roller, you'll want the original density (blue). Even though this is our \"softest\" roller, it's still more aggressive than any other foam roller on the market. The extra-firm version (black) is intended for experienced users with especially dense muscle tissue that doesn't respond to normal massage pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller's Premium Materials Provide Lasting Value\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore creating the RumbleRoller, we spent years studying other foam rollers, and testing many different types of advanced polymers. Our material research resulted in a product that has several times the strength and tear resistance of conventional rollers, has a wonderful feel, permanently retains its shape, and is guaranteed to outlast and outperform any foam roller that you've ever used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's smooth, nonporous surface repels most dirt. It's water-proof and includes a molded-in antimicrobial additive that helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus. To clean your RumbleRoller, simply wipe it down as needed with soap and water or any common household cleaner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller Safety Information\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth versions of the RumbleRoller (original density and extra-firm) have been tested by an independent laboratory in accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 for lead and phthalates.

Compress Soft Tissue\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhysical therapists, trainers, and athletes use foam rollers to relieve muscular pain and tightness (often called \"adhesions\", \"knots\", or \"trigger points\"). But conventional foam rollers have smooth surfaces that further compress soft tissue. Rolling on top of them improves blood flow and tissue flexibility, but the effect is limited and relatively superficial, unless you spend a lot of time rolling.  The RumbleRoller was created to perform this therapy more effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe RumbleRoller Manipulates Soft Tissue - Like a Massage Therapist!\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe surface of the RumbleRoller contains specially designed bumps that are firm, but flexible, much like the thumbs of a massage therapist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you roll over the top of the RumbleRoller, the bumps continuously knead the contours of your body, gently stretching soft tissue (muscle and fascia) in multiple directions. This action erodes trigger points, helps restore flexibility, and brings quick relief to common types of muscular pain. By design, the RumbleRoller's bumps are firmer than muscle tissue, but much softer than bone, so they deflect out of the way if they contact your spine or other bony protrusions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough simple techniques, you can control the amount of pressure the bumps apply to your body. The bumps are closely spaced to one another (\u0026lt; 2\" apart), so several of them simultaneously contact your body during most exercises. However, with a slight shift of your body, you can reduce your area of contact with the RumbleRoller, which increases pressure and provides deeper, more penetrating relief. RumbleRoller foam roller with bumps\u003cbr\u003eAdd Another Dimension to Your Foam Roller Program\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's massaging action can be further intensified by changing your movement from a back-and-forth rolling motion to a side-to-side rocking motion. That's because the RumbleRoller's bumps have an asymmetrical shape that allows them to flex more easily in one direction. During rolling movements (i.e. the most common roller exercises, with the roller moving beneath you), the bumps flex relatively easily, and provide a wiping-type massage pressure. However, if you rock from side-to-side toward the RumbleRoller's ends, the bumps are forced to flex in a direction in which they're designed to be somewhat stiffer. This creates a deeper \"digging\" pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich Roller is Best for You?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller is made in two different sizes, and each size is available in two different densities. The information below will help you choose the best model for your particular needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull-Size or Compact\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you plan to use your RumbleRoller in a single location -- e.g. at home -- you'll love the full-size model, because its extra length makes it more efficient for performing many exercises. It's long enough to roll the widest part of your back in one pass; you can roll both legs (quads, hamstrings, and\/or calves) at the same time; and you can even transition from one IT band to the other without moving the roller. With the Compact RumbleRoller, you'll need to roll each leg separately, and will spend a little more time repositioning yourself between exercises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major advantage the Compact RumbleRoller has over the full-size model is its portability. At just 12\" in length, it fits easily in your gym bag, backpack, or carry-on luggage. This makes it a favorite of many runners and triathletes who transport theirs from race to race. The Compact RumbleRoller's smaller diameter (5\" vs. 6\" for the full-size model) allows it to conform better to the curvature of some body parts, such as your neck. The Compact RumbleRoller also costs less than the full-size model, which may be important if your budget is limited. Compact RR is perfect for travel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Density or Extra-Firm\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you're new to foam rolling or have gotten positive results from any type of conventional foam roller, you'll want the original density (blue). Even though this is our \"softest\" roller, it's still more aggressive than any other foam roller on the market. The extra-firm version (black) is intended for experienced users with especially dense muscle tissue that doesn't respond to normal massage pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller's Premium Materials Provide Lasting Value\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore creating the RumbleRoller, we spent years studying other foam rollers, and testing many different types of advanced polymers. Our material research resulted in a product that has several times the strength and tear resistance of conventional rollers, has a wonderful feel, permanently retains its shape, and is guaranteed to outlast and outperform any foam roller that you've ever used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's smooth, nonporous surface repels most dirt. It's water-proof and includes a molded-in antimicrobial additive that helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus. To clean your RumbleRoller, simply wipe it down as needed with soap and water or any common household cleaner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller Safety Information\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth versions of the RumbleRoller (original density and extra-firm) have been tested by an independent laboratory in accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 for lead and phthalates. Both toxins were below detectible levels, which the CPSIA considers safe for use by children age 12 and under.

But conventional foam rollers have smooth surfaces that further compress soft tissue. Rolling on top of them improves blood flow and tissue flexibility, but the effect is limited and relatively superficial, unless you spend a lot of time rolling.  The RumbleRoller was created to perform this therapy more effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe RumbleRoller Manipulates Soft Tissue - Like a Massage Therapist!\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe surface of the RumbleRoller contains specially designed bumps that are firm, but flexible, much like the thumbs of a massage therapist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you roll over the top of the RumbleRoller, the bumps continuously knead the contours of your body, gently stretching soft tissue (muscle and fascia) in multiple directions. This action erodes trigger points, helps restore flexibility, and brings quick relief to common types of muscular pain. By design, the RumbleRoller's bumps are firmer than muscle tissue, but much softer than bone, so they deflect out of the way if they contact your spine or other bony protrusions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough simple techniques, you can control the amount of pressure the bumps apply to your body. The bumps are closely spaced to one another (\u0026lt; 2\" apart), so several of them simultaneously contact your body during most exercises. However, with a slight shift of your body, you can reduce your area of contact with the RumbleRoller, which increases pressure and provides deeper, more penetrating relief. RumbleRoller foam roller with bumps\u003cbr\u003eAdd Another Dimension to Your Foam Roller Program\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's massaging action can be further intensified by changing your movement from a back-and-forth rolling motion to a side-to-side rocking motion. That's because the RumbleRoller's bumps have an asymmetrical shape that allows them to flex more easily in one direction. During rolling movements (i.e. the most common roller exercises, with the roller moving beneath you), the bumps flex relatively easily, and provide a wiping-type massage pressure. However, if you rock from side-to-side toward the RumbleRoller's ends, the bumps are forced to flex in a direction in which they're designed to be somewhat stiffer. This creates a deeper \"digging\" pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich Roller is Best for You?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller is made in two different sizes, and each size is available in two different densities. The information below will help you choose the best model for your particular needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull-Size or Compact\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you plan to use your RumbleRoller in a single location -- e.g. at home -- you'll love the full-size model, because its extra length makes it more efficient for performing many exercises. It's long enough to roll the widest part of your back in one pass; you can roll both legs (quads, hamstrings, and\/or calves) at the same time; and you can even transition from one IT band to the other without moving the roller. With the Compact RumbleRoller, you'll need to roll each leg separately, and will spend a little more time repositioning yourself between exercises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major advantage the Compact RumbleRoller has over the full-size model is its portability. At just 12\" in length, it fits easily in your gym bag, backpack, or carry-on luggage. This makes it a favorite of many runners and triathletes who transport theirs from race to race. The Compact RumbleRoller's smaller diameter (5\" vs. 6\" for the full-size model) allows it to conform better to the curvature of some body parts, such as your neck. The Compact RumbleRoller also costs less than the full-size model, which may be important if your budget is limited. Compact RR is perfect for travel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Density or Extra-Firm\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you're new to foam rolling or have gotten positive results from any type of conventional foam roller, you'll want the original density (blue). Even though this is our \"softest\" roller, it's still more aggressive than any other foam roller on the market. The extra-firm version (black) is intended for experienced users with especially dense muscle tissue that doesn't respond to normal massage pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller's Premium Materials Provide Lasting Value\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore creating the RumbleRoller, we spent years studying other foam rollers, and testing many different types of advanced polymers. Our material research resulted in a product that has several times the strength and tear resistance of conventional rollers, has a wonderful feel, permanently retains its shape, and is guaranteed to outlast and outperform any foam roller that you've ever used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's smooth, nonporous surface repels most dirt. It's water-proof and includes a molded-in antimicrobial additive that helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus. To clean your RumbleRoller, simply wipe it down as needed with soap and water or any common household cleaner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller Safety Information\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth versions of the RumbleRoller (original density and extra-firm) have been tested by an independent laboratory in accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 for lead and phthalates. Both toxins were below detectible levels, which the CPSIA considers safe for use by children age 12 and under. All RumbleRoller products are also latex-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach RumbleRoller is packaged with an illustrated Instruction Guide that shows ten basic techniques for

Unfortunately, though, they aren't practical to use on hard-to-reach areas like your back, shoulders, and arms. And sometimes you have to put a LOT of pressure on the massager to get the effect you're looking for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Beastie Bar was created to overcome these limitations. Instead of the smooth plastic rollers of a conventional stick massager, it uses a pair of Beasties with firm, high-profile bumps.

But conventional foam rollers have smooth surfaces that further compress soft tissue. Rolling on top of them improves blood flow and tissue flexibility, but the effect is limited and relatively superficial, unless you spend a lot of time rolling.  The RumbleRoller was created to perform this therapy more effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe RumbleRoller Manipulates Soft Tissue - Like a Massage Therapist!\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe surface of the RumbleRoller contains specially designed bumps that are firm, but flexible, much like the thumbs of a massage therapist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you roll over the top of the RumbleRoller, the bumps continuously knead the contours of your body, gently stretching soft tissue (muscle and fascia) in multiple directions. This action erodes trigger points, helps restore flexibility, and brings quick relief to common types of muscular pain. By design, the RumbleRoller's bumps are firmer than muscle tissue, but much softer than bone, so they deflect out of the way if they contact your spine or other bony protrusions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough simple techniques, you can control the amount of pressure the bumps apply to your body. The bumps are closely spaced to one another (\u0026lt; 2\" apart), so several of them simultaneously contact your body during most exercises. However, with a slight shift of your body, you can reduce your area of contact with the RumbleRoller, which increases pressure and provides deeper, more penetrating relief. RumbleRoller foam roller with bumps\u003cbr\u003eAdd Another Dimension to Your Foam Roller Program\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's massaging action can be further intensified by changing your movement from a back-and-forth rolling motion to a side-to-side rocking motion. That's because the RumbleRoller's bumps have an asymmetrical shape that allows them to flex more easily in one direction. During rolling movements (i.e. the most common roller exercises, with the roller moving beneath you), the bumps flex relatively easily, and provide a wiping-type massage pressure. However, if you rock from side-to-side toward the RumbleRoller's ends, the bumps are forced to flex in a direction in which they're designed to be somewhat stiffer. This creates a deeper \"digging\" pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich Roller is Best for You?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller is made in two different sizes, and each size is available in two different densities. The information below will help you choose the best model for your particular needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull-Size or Compact\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you plan to use your RumbleRoller in a single location -- e.g. at home -- you'll love the full-size model, because its extra length makes it more efficient for performing many exercises. It's long enough to roll the widest part of your back in one pass; you can roll both legs (quads, hamstrings, and\/or calves) at the same time; and you can even transition from one IT band to the other without moving the roller. With the Compact RumbleRoller, you'll need to roll each leg separately, and will spend a little more time repositioning yourself between exercises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major advantage the Compact RumbleRoller has over the full-size model is its portability. At just 12\" in length, it fits easily in your gym bag, backpack, or carry-on luggage. This makes it a favorite of many runners and triathletes who transport theirs from race to race. The Compact RumbleRoller's smaller diameter (5\" vs. 6\" for the full-size model) allows it to conform better to the curvature of some body parts, such as your neck. The Compact RumbleRoller also costs less than the full-size model, which may be important if your budget is limited. Compact RR is perfect for travel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Density or Extra-Firm\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you're new to foam rolling or have gotten positive results from any type of conventional foam roller, you'll want the original density (blue). Even though this is our \"softest\" roller, it's still more aggressive than any other foam roller on the market. The extra-firm version (black) is intended for experienced users with especially dense muscle tissue that doesn't respond to normal massage pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller's Premium Materials Provide Lasting Value\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore creating the RumbleRoller, we spent years studying other foam rollers, and testing many different types of advanced polymers. Our material research resulted in a product that has several times the strength and tear resistance of conventional rollers, has a wonderful feel, permanently retains its shape, and is guaranteed to outlast and outperform any foam roller that you've ever used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RumbleRoller's smooth, nonporous surface repels most dirt. It's water-proof and includes a molded-in antimicrobial additive that helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus. To clean your RumbleRoller, simply wipe it down as needed with soap and water or any common household cleaner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRumbleRoller Safety Information\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth versions of the RumbleRoller (original density and extra-firm) have been tested by an independent laboratory in accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 for lead and phthalates. Both toxins were below detectible levels, which the CPSIA considers safe for use by children age 12 and under. All RumbleRoller products are also latex-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach RumbleRoller is packaged with an illustrated Instruction Guide that shows ten basic techniques for

Bearings have a limited 90-day warranty.  For PVC options, see the PVC version.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2015-02-25T12:06:00-06:00","created_at":"2015-02-25T12:06:16-06:00","updated_at":"2019-12-27T14:29:43-06:00","vendor":"Jumprope","product_type":"Jump Ropes","tags":["conditioning","Fitness Accessories","fitness-west-calgary-edmonton-less-than-50","jump-ropes","jumprope","less-than-100","less-than-1000","less-than-250","less-than-2500","less-than-50","less-than-500","less-than-5000","misc","skip","skipping"],"variants":[{"id":1200117159,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"JREJBWH","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"29.99","grams":998,"compare_at_price":"0.00","position":1,"product_id":459456819,"created_at":"2015-02-25T12:06:16-06:00","updated_at":"2019-12-27T14:29:43-06:00"}],"images":[{"id":1264702455,"created_at":"2015-04-20T15:58:14-05:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-20T15:58:14-05:00","product_id":459456819,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0680\/1801\/products\/hires_177.jpeg?v=1429563494","width":500,"height":500}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":459456815,"title":"JumpRope 9ft Speed Rope","handle":"jumprope-9ft-speed-rope","body_html":"\u003ch6\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOverview\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHigh quality, smooth-turning ropes recommended for general purpose skipping.
