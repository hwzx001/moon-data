Napa Valley AVA is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Viticultural_Area\">American Viticultural Area</a> established in 1981 and is located in the much larger North Coast AVA in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California\">Napa County</a> north of San Francisco. Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Patchett\">John Patchett</a> established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Krug\">Charles Krug</a> established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Helena,_California\">St. Helena</a>. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera\">phylloxera</a>, the institution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States\">Prohibition</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression\">Great Depression</a>. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)\">Paris Wine Tasting of 1976</a>, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enotourism\">enotourism</a> destination.</p>\n<p> The valley floor is flanked by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains\">Mayacamas Mountain Range</a> on the western and northern sides the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaca_Mountains\">Vaca Mountains</a> on the eastern side. Several smaller valleys exist within these two ranges. The floor of the main valley gradually rises from sea level at the southern end to 362 feet above sea level at the northern end in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calistoga,_California\">Calistoga</a> at the foot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Saint_Helena\">Mount Saint Helena</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakville_AVA\">Oakville</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_AVA\">Rutherford</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Viticultural_Area\">American Viticultural Areas</a> lie within a geographical area known as the Rutherford Bench in the center of the valley floor. The soil in the southern end of the valley consists mainly of sediments deposited by earlier advances and retreats of San Pablo Bay while the soil at the northern end of the valley contains a large volume of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano\">volcanic</a> lava and ash. Several of the small hills that emerge from the middle of the valley floor near <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yountville,_California\">Yountville</a> are indicators of the region's volcanic past.</p>\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoclimate\">mesoclimates</a> exist within the area due to various weather and geographical influences. The open southern end of the valley floor is cooler during the growing season due to the proximity of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pablo_Bay\">San Pablo Bay</a> while the sheltered, closed northern end is often much warmer. The eastern side of the valley tends to be more arid because winter storms tend to drop much more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)\">precipitation</a> on the western mountains and hills.</p>\n<p>Early pioneer and settler <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Yount\">George C. Yount</a> is generally credited to have been the first to grow grapes in the Napa Valley. In 1864, on the marriage of one of his granddaughters to Thomas Rutherford, Yount gave the couple around 1,000 acres of land, which Rutherford dedicated to winemaking. Commercial production started in 1858, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Patchett\">John Patchett</a> selling wine for $2 per gallon. His wine cellar, built in 1859, narrowly predates that established in 1861 in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Helena,_California\">St. Helena</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Krug\">Charles Krug</a>, although this is commonly cited as the Napa Valley's first winery. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Niebaum\">Captain Gustave Niebaum</a> established <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglenook_Winery\">Inglenook Winery</a> in 1879 near the village of Rutherford. This was the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux\">Bordeaux</a> style winery in the USA. Inglenook wines won gold medals at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Universelle_(1889)\">1889 World's Fair in Paris</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1868 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._W._Crabb\">H. W. Crabb</a> bought land near Oakville close to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_River\">Napa River</a>. Crabb established a vineyard and winery named To Kalon, and by 1877 had planted 130 acres and was producing 50,000 US gallons of wine per year. Crabb experimented with over 400 grape varieties to find the types best suited for the area.</p>\n<p>By the end of the nineteenth century there were more than one hundred and forty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery\">wineries</a> in the area. Of those original wineries, several still exist in the valley today including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaulieu_Vineyard\">Beaulieu</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringer_Vineyards\">Beringer</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Krug\">Charles Krug</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Montelena\">Chateau Montelena</a>, Far Niente, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Vineyards\">Mayacamas</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham_Vineyards\">Markham Vineyards</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schramsberg_Vineyards\">Schramsberg Vineyards</a>. Today within the Napa Valley AVA there are 16 sub AVAs with over 400 wineries. *source Wikipedia.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.americanwineryguide.com/regions/wineries_list/napa-valley-ava/\">http://www.americanwineryguide.com/regions/wineries_list/napa-valley-ava/</a></p>\n<p><b><i>*Please note: The paper print dimensions include a .25\" border on all 4 sides within the final size of the print.

the Russian River Valley AVA which is located in Sonoma County north of San Francisco. The Russian River Valley AVA accounts for about one-sixth of the total planted vineyard acreage in Sonoma County. Granted AVA status in 1983, the Russian River Valley has a characteristically cool climate, heavily affected by fog generated by the valley's proximity to the Pacific Ocean. The geography of the Russian River Valley was shaped millions of years ago by collisions between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates and eruptions by volcanic vents that deposited volcanic ash over layers of eroded bedrock. This created sandstone of loam known as \"Goldridge soil\" Although this area is known for cool climate varietals notably Pinot noir and Chardonnay, there are other varieties that do well in this region: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante_Bouschet\">Alicante Bouschet</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arneis\">Arneis</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbera\">Barbera</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Muscat\">Black Muscat</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabernet_Franc\">Cabernet Franc</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabernet_Sauvignon\">Cabernet Sauvignon</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaiolo_nero\">Canaiolo nero</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carignane\">Carignane</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardonnay\">Chardonnay</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenin_blanc\">Chenin blanc</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinsault\">Cinsault</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolcetto\">Dolcetto</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Burgundy\">Early Burgundy</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freisa\">Freisa</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewurztraminer\">Gewurztraminer</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenache\">Grenache</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbec\">Malbec</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammolo\">Mammolo</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsanne\">Marsanne</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot\">Merlot</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat_Canelli\">Muscat Canelli</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_Verdot\">Petit Verdot</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petite_Sirah\">Petite Sirah</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_blanc\">Pinot blanc</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_gris\">Pinot gris</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_Meunier\">Pinot Meunier</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_noir\">Pinot noir</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinotage\">Pinotage</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussanne\">Roussanne</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangiovese\">Sangiovese</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauvignon_blanc\">Sauvignon blanc</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semillon\">Semillon</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrah\">Syrah</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousseau_gris\">Trousseau gris</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viognier\">Viognier</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinfandel\">Zinfandel.</a></p>\n<p> Wineries &amp; vineyards include: Gary Farrell Vineyards &amp; Winery, J Rochioli Vineyards &amp; Winery, Williams Selyem Winery, Russian River Vineyards, Arista Winery, Matrix Winery, Jordan Vineyard &amp; Winery, Holdredge Wines, Ramey Wine Cellars, Wine Road, Acorn Winery, J Vineyards &amp; Winery, Moshin Vineyards, Porter Creek Vineyards, C Donatiello Winery, Hartford Family Winery, Rodney Strong Vineyards, Alquimista Cellars, Ancient Oak Cellars, Bacigalupi Vineyards, Bailarin Cellars, Balletto Vineyards, Bruliam Wines, Bucher Wines, Camlow Cellars, Camlow Cellars, Campana Ranch Winery, Cartograph Wines, Char Vale Winery, Chenoweth Wines, Christopher Creek Winery, Cleary Ranch Vineyards &amp; Winery, Croix Estate, D &amp; L Carinalli Vineyards, Davis Bynum Winery, Davis Family Vineyards, Dehlinger Winery, DeLoach Vineyards, Domaine Della, DRNK Wines, Dutton Estate Winery/Sebastopol Vineyards, Dutton-Goldfield Winery, Ektimo Vineyards, Emeritus Vineyards, Enriquez Estate Wines, EnRoute Winery, Freeman Vineyard &amp; Winery, Furthermore Wines, George Wine Company, Germone Hill Vineyard, Gold Ridge Vineyards, Gordian Knot Winery, Graton Ridge Cellars, Hartford Family Winery, Harvest Moon Estate &amp; Winery, Holdredge Wines, Hook &amp; Ladder Vineyards and Winery, Inman Family Wines, Iron Horse Vineyards, J Cage Cellars, J Vineyards &amp; Winery, J.

Canvas","handle":"temecula-valley-ava-giclee-poster-print-on-paper-or-canvas","body_html":"<p>This giclee print painted by artist kerne Erickson depicts the Temecula Valley AVA located in southwestern Riverside County. It was established as an AVA in 1984 and today has over 1300 planted acres of vineyards. Hot air balloons are a fun way to appreciate this region. Temecula is subjected to drier and higher temperatures than its northern AVAs. As the sun warms the inland valleys east of Temecula Valley during the day, the air rises, which draws the moisture from the Pacific Ocean inland overnight to cool the grapes. The cool nighttime temperatures are critical in developing of high quality grapes. Temecula Valley soils are another significant influence on wine quality. The soils are created from decomposing granite and are excellent for growing high quality grapes. Grapevines require well-drained soils; they don't like their roots to be constantly wet. The granite soils permit the water to drain through quite easily. These soils contribute to clean, pure varietal flavors without odd or herbaceous flavors that wetter soil may cause.<sup> </sup> The top grape varieties are: chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Viognier, Pinot Gris, Merlot.</p>\n<p>Some of the wineries here are: Frangipani Winery, Callaway Vineyard, Hart Family Winery, Vindemia Vineyard, Longshadow Ranch Vineyard, Keyways Vineyard, Leonesse Cellars, Europa Village, Monte De Oro Winery and Bella Vista Winery.</p>\n<p><b><i>*Please note: The paper print dimensions include a .25\" border on all 4 sides within the final size of the print.

Giclée Poster Print on Paper or Canvas","handle":"el-dorado-ava-giclee-poster-print-on-paper-or-canvas","body_html":"<p>This giclee print by artist kerne Erickson depicts the El Dorado AVA in El Dorado County of the Sierra Foothills AVA. El Dorado became an AVA in 1983. The city of Placerville is located in this region. Its vines are planted between 1200 and 3500 feet. Because of the vineyards being planted at these elevations the El Dorado AVA is cooled rather than by the fog that is common to the coastal regions. In conjunction with the climate, there are three basic soil types determining the characteristics of the region: fine-grained volcanic rock, decomposed granite and fine-grained shale. Varying in elevation and topography, each soil offers good drainage and the nutrients needed to encourage vines producing rich, deeply flavored grapes. These microclimates provide ideal locations for growing a wide variety of grapes identified with the world's finest wine regions, including Bordeaux, the Rhône, Germany, Italy and Spain. El Dorado grows approximately 50 different varieties of grapes, ranging from Gewürztraminer, which does best in the higher and cooler portions of the county, to Zinfandel and Barbera, which ripen perfectly in warmer climates.</p>\n<p>Wineries &amp; Vineyards in this region are: Auriga Wine Cellars, Boeger Winery, Bumgarner Winery, Busby Cellars, C.G. di Arie Vineyard &amp; Winery, Cantiga Wineworks, Cedarville Vineyard, Chate’au Davell, Cielo Estate, Colibri Ridge Winery &amp; Vineyard, David Girard Vineyards, E16, Element 79, Everhart Cellars &amp; Hart 2 Hart Vineyards, Fenton Herriot Vineyards, Findleton Estate &amp; Vineyards, Gold Hill Vineyard &amp; Brewery, Gwinllan Estate Vineyard &amp; Winery, Holly’s Hill Vineyards, Jodar Vineyards &amp; Winery, Latcham Vineyards, Lava Cap Winery, Lewis Grace, Madrona, Miraflores, Mount Aukum Winery, Narrow Gate Vineyards, Nell O Olivo Wines, Oakstone Winery, Perry Creek Winery, Rucksack Cellars, Salutui Cellars, Sierra Vista Vineyards &amp; Winery, Shadow Ranch Vineyard, Sentivo Vineyards &amp; Winery, Single leaf Vineyards &amp; Winery, Skinner Vineyards &amp; Winery, Smokey Ridge Winery, Via Romano Vineyards, Windwalker Vineyard and Wofford Acres Vineyards.</p>\n<p><b><i>*Please note: The paper print dimensions include a .25\" border on all 4 sides within the final size of the print.

Most of the vineyards in the Fiddletown AVA are located in the south and west portion of the region at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 feet. About 20% of the wine produced in Amador County comes from the Fiddletown AVA. Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Barbera and Grenache are a few of this regions varieties that stand out. Decomposed granite along with volcanic loam soils are commonly found in this region and at the higher elevations in the area.

The total area of the appellation is 2,600,000 acres, one of five largest AVAs in the state along with the North Coast AVA, Central Coast AVA and the South Coast AVA. 5,700 acres of the appellation are planted to grapevines. The most common grape variety is Zinfandel which accounts for 2,300 acres. Cabernet Sauvignon is planted on 600 acres and Syrah is planted to 560 acres. The most common white grape variety is Chardonnay planted to 289 acres. Other grape varieties are grown in smaller quantities.

Oaks that are indigenous in this region of California.   The Monterey AVA was established in 1984 and is a sub AVA of the much larger Central Coast AVA. Within this AVA lie the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, Arroyo Seco AVA, San Lucas AVA, Hames Valley AVA, Chalone AVA, Carmel Valley AVA, San Antonio Valley AVA and the San Bernabe AVA. This region, which has over 50,000 planted wine grapes, is predominantly planted in Chardonnay. The northern portion is a cool growing region and best suited to Pinot Noir. Although the southern part of the Monterey AVA can reach temperatures up to 100 degrees, temperatures rarely exceed 75 °F (24 °C). <sup> </sup>The soil is sandy to sandy loam requiring extensive irrigation.</p>\n<p> This area is home to over 150 vineyards and wineries producing some of California’s top award wining wines.</p>\n<p><b><i>*Please note: The paper print dimensions include a .25\" border on all 4 sides within the final size of the print.

Obispo County north of Los Angeles. Paso Robles greater area is the largest AVA by square acres in California with over 610,000. There are over 40,000 planted acres of vines with more than 40 wine grape varieties. In this giant AVA there are over 45 different soil series, including granite, sedimentary, volcanic, sandstone, and Calcareous soil. Calcareous soils are a clay-based soil with high lime content, which produces higher pH levels. The high pH reduces the vine’s vigor, allowing for flavor concentration and retention of acidity in wine. Although this viticultural area was founded in 1983, its roots for grape growing date back to 1797 by the missionaries that imported grape vine stock to the Mission San Miguel Arcangel. Today the Paso Robles AVA has 11 smaller sub AVAs: Adelaida District AVA, Creston District AVA, El Pomar District AVA, Paso Robles Estrella District AVA, Paso Robles Geneseo District AVA, Paso Robles Highlands District AVA, Paso Robles Willow Creek District AVA, San Juan Creek AVA, Santa Margarita Ranch AVA and Templeton Gap District AVA. A few of the grapes planted are: Zinfandel, Syrah, Tannat,Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Chardonnay, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Barbera.</p>\n<p> There are over 200 wineries in this region. A few are Tobin James, Eberle Winery, DAOU Vineyards, Niner Wine Estates, Denner Vineyards, Robert Hall Winery, Vina Robles Vineyards &amp; Winery, Halter Ranch Vineyard, Herman Story Wines, Brochelle Vineyards, L’Aventure, Sextant Wines, Opolo Vineyards, McPrice Myers, Caliza Winery, JDusi Wines, Alta Colina Vineyard, Peachy Canyon Winery and Justin Vineyards &amp; Winery.</p>\n<p><b><i>*Please note: The paper print dimensions include a .25\" border on all 4 sides within the final size of the print.
