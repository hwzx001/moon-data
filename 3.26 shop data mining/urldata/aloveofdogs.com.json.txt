Each figural glass ornament produced by Old World Christmas is hand crafted in age-old tradition using the same techniques that originated in the 1800's. Molten glass is mouth-blown into finely carved molds made exclusively for Old World Christmas, before a hot solution of liquid silver is poured inside. The ornaments are then hand-painted and glittered in a series of labor-intensive steps to achieve the beautiful creations.\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2019-01-13T18:55:44-05:00","created_at":"2018-07-29T07:42:57-04:00","updated_at":"2019-12-13T18:29:30-05:00","vendor":"Old World Christmas","product_type":"Ornament","tags":["OWC","tenner"],"variants":[{"id":12450822619222,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"OWCFRIDGE","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"featured_image":null,"available":false,"price":"15.99","grams":198,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":1361716084822,"created_at":"2018-07-29T07:42:57-04:00","updated_at":"2019-12-13T18:29:30-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":3784877310038,"created_at":"2018-07-29T16:46:16-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2018-07-29T16:46:16-04:00","product_id":1361716084822,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0896\/2238\/products\/Retro_Refrigerator_Ornament.png?v=1532897176","width":1000,"height":1000}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":14765228046,"title":"Paperproducts Design 603198 Oliver Gift Boxed Mug, 13.5 oz, Brown","handle":"paperproducts-design-603198-oliver-gift-boxed-mug-13-5-oz-brown","body_html":null,"published_at":"2019-01-13T18:55:44-05:00","created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:55-04:00","updated_at":"2020-02-02T15:42:06-05:00","vendor":"Paperproducts Design","product_type":"","tags":["tenner"],"variants":[{"id":58375929870,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"PPDBEAGLEMUG","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"10.00","grams":454,"compare_at_price":"1699.00","position":1,"product_id":14765228046,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:55-04:00","updated_at":"2020-02-02T15:42:06-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":38018023438,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:59-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:59-04:00","product_id":14765228046,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0896\/2238\/products\/7fd91eba-5b48-5348-9927-85408fe0b3a7.jpg?v=1509060059","width":500,"height":500}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":14764867598,"title":"Paperproducts Design 603197 Amanda Gift Boxed Mug, 13.5 oz, Brown","handle":"paperproducts-design-603197-amanda-gift-boxed-mug-13-5-oz-brown","body_html":null,"published_at":"2019-01-13T18:55:43-05:00","created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:48-04:00","updated_at":"2019-01-13T18:55:44-05:00","vendor":"Paperproducts Design","product_type":"","tags":["tenner"],"variants":[{"id":58375536654,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"PPDORANGETABBYMUG","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"10.00","grams":454,"compare_at_price":"16.99","position":1,"product_id":14764867598,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:48-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-27T19:26:24-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":38017204238,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:53-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:53-04:00","product_id":14764867598,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0896\/2238\/products\/67301665-2584-5cff-8912-0ea6d2337d13.jpg?v=1509060053","width":500,"height":500}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":14764572686,"title":"Paperproducts Design 602348 Reggie Gift Boxed Mug, 13.5 oz, Blue","handle":"paperproducts-design-602348-reggie-gift-boxed-mug-13-5-oz-blue","body_html":null,"published_at":"2019-01-13T18:55:43-05:00","created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:41-04:00","updated_at":"2020-01-07T16:18:41-05:00","vendor":"Paperproducts Design","product_type":"","tags":["51015sale","tenner"],"variants":[{"id":58374881294,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"PPDBULLDOGMUG","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"10.00","grams":454,"compare_at_price":"16.99","position":1,"product_id":14764572686,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:41-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-27T19:26:23-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":38016483342,"created_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:46-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2017-10-26T19:20:46-04:00","product_id":14764572686,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0896\/2238\/products\/e1fc7a80-e99d-5437-abd3-ae6723cfb120.jpg?v=1509060046","width":500,"height":500}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":10075994766,"title":"Set of 4 Cotton Cloth Napkins - Mary Lake Thompson - Antique Bird Cages","handle":"set-of-4-cotton-cloth-napkins-mary-lake-thompson-antique-bird-cages","body_html":"A charming bundle of quality cotton cloth napkins, printed individually for the proper napkin fold!

Each figural glass ornament produced by Old World Christmas is hand crafted in age-old tradition using the same techniques that originated in the 1800's. Molten glass is mouth-blown into finely carved molds made exclusively for Old World Christmas, before a hot solution of liquid silver is poured inside. The ornaments are then hand-painted and glittered in a series of labor-intensive steps to achieve the beautiful creations.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","published_at":"2018-07-27T19:03:33-04:00","created_at":"2018-07-27T19:03:33-04:00","updated_at":"2019-12-23T07:17:50-05:00","vendor":"Old World Christmas","product_type":"Ornament","tags":["FIFTYBUNCH","OWC"],"variants":[{"id":12450070364246,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"OWCSTAFFIE","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"15.99","grams":2722,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":1361468293206,"created_at":"2018-07-27T19:03:33-04:00","updated_at":"2019-12-20T13:33:28-05:00"}],"images":[{"id":3783618494550,"created_at":"2018-07-27T19:03:40-04:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2018-07-27T19:03:41-04:00","product_id":1361468293206,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0896\/2238\/products\/d8978380-bbc8-5db1-882a-6145ac799f1a.jpg?v=1532732621","width":500,"height":500}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":7196960515,"title":"Swimming Trout Jacquard Kitchen Dish Towel - 100% Cotton, 18\" x 28\"","handle":"swimming-trout-jacquard-kitchen-dish-towel-100-cotton-18-x-28","body_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEvery season is cooking season, our favorite time to pull out fun kitchen dish towels, heavy enough for the big indoor and outdoor cooking jobs!
