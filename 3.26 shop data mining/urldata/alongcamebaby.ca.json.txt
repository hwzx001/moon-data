The BFF will. It has tons of pockets and organization...so much you won't know what to do with it all. Is she flexible? The BFF comes with detachable shoulder straps and messenger straps. Use it any way you want! Does she have spice and flair and elegance and style? If she does, then you better dump her right away, she might make you look bad! Just kinda sorta kidding mostly...but seriously, if she does, then you need a BFF just to keep up. Smooches, pinkie swears, and forever friends.

It might make your current BFF a little jealous, but that's OK because she wasn't all that good of a friend anyway.</p>\n<p>Just a few questions: Did she ever offer to carry all of your stuff in an ultra organized way? The BFF will. It has tons of pockets and organization...so much you won't know what to do with it all. Is she flexible? The BFF comes with detachable shoulder straps and messenger straps. Use it any way you want! Does she have spice and flair and elegance and style? If she does, then you better dump her right away, she might make you look bad! Just kinda sorta kidding mostly...but seriously, if she does, then you need a BFF just to keep up. Smooches, pinkie swears, and forever friends.

Introducing the Be Nurtured … the latest addition in our line of breast pump bags. The size is just right – smaller than our Be Pumped yet bigger than our Be Supplied. This bag discreetly stores your pump in the exterior zippered pocket and you can even keep it in the bag while pumping! Plenty of other pockets will keep your pumping accessories and everyday items organized. And if you don’t pump, then don’t worry because this hybrid bag is a multi-tasker just like you! It can double as a diaper bag, carry-on bag or your favorite grab-n-go bag. Not to mention, it can be carried four different ways – as a convertible backpack, a messenger bag, by the grab handle or hung from your stroller. The Be Nurtured will support you in all your parenting needs.
